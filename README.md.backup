# Meterpreter-Custom-Scripts

This repository includes some custom Meterpreter scripts to help automate pentests.


## Why This?

After conducting numerous manual and automated pentests, I have decided to release some of my Meterpreter scripts that I use for automating pentests. This repository consists of scripts for each platform (Windows/Linux) in a directory-like structure. I have also provided a brief guide on how to import these scripts into the Metasploit Framework and use them accordingly.


## How to Import Scripts?

### Download the Script

In this case, I am using the script windump.rb, which is available in this repository in the POST/Windows module.

### Copy the Script

After downloading the script, copy it into the directory mentioned below:

```
cp windump.rb /usr/share/metasploti-framework/modules/post/windows/gather

```

### Start Metasploit

Since this is a POST script, we need to have a stable connection to the victim machine.

Use the following options to run the script:


```
search windump

use post/windows/gather/windump

set SESSION <session id>

set ALL true

run

```

It is recommended to see all the available options in the script using the following commands:

```
show options

show info
```


### Output Location

After the script runs, the outputs will most likely display on the Metasploit screen. For some scripts, you need to visit the location mentioned below:

```
cd /home/<user-name>/.msf4/logs/scripts/windump
```



## More Scripts

In the future, I will release more scripts in this repository. Even better, why don't you contribute some of your scripts to this repository? I would really appreciate your contribution.

# REFERENCES

- I am often asked how to build a programming mindset in the hacking/pentesting career. My simple answer is to learn the language syntax and then do as many small projects in that language as possible. If you really want to learn some basics of coding for pentesting or hacking, I highly recommend you read the book mentioned below. For simplicity in working with Meterpreter scripts, I have taken the example of the windump.rb file from this book.
